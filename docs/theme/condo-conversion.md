# Subtheme: Condo Conversions
In 2023, MAPC released the “Homes for Profit” report about the negative effects of speculation in the Metro Boston housing market by investors, including driving up prices and displacing residents. One thing that investors often do when they buy properties to “flip” them is to convert rental properties into condos. This can have the effect of displacing tenants who can’t afford to buy the properties they were previously renting. In this subtheme, student groups can explore two completely novel datasets of condo conversions in Cambridge and Boston between 2015-2024, looking for spatial and demographic patterns. Did these new condos displace longtime residents? Are condo conversions taking place in particular areas or in communities with particular demographic characteristics? Who are the owners of the condos and are they from the community?

# Getting Help
The class staff are very committed to your learning. We’re here to help you, and we offer the following resources to support you:

- For **administrative questions** (e.g., regarding due dates, or interpreting assignment instructions); for **technical questions** about programming or the technology stack; for questions about **ideas taught in lecture or broader questions about visualization**, data analysis, and design: post publicly in the appropriate category of the [class forum](). This ensures that our answer will benefit the entire class!

- For help when you’re **feeling confused** on data analysis, visualization design, or programming issues, can’t formulate a question, or would like advice about your work: go to office hours (schedule posted below). Please do not email the TAs individually to ask for help.

- For a **personal issue** about grading, attendance, or team issues: send an email to the staff mailing list, vis-society-staff@mit.edu

- For a **private problem** or for **friendly live advice**: email the lecturers—we’d be delighted to chat with you!
